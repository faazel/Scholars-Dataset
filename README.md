# Scholars Dataset
This jupyter notebook is to make a list of dataframes, containing a scholar's publications and publishers scientometrics. Such dataframe can be used for developing models and gain a better understanding of the correlations between scientometrics.

Note that I've used a library based on Scopus API and you should have acces to scopus (via you institute for instance)

I have used ISID scraping to retrive the scholars names of my faculty. you may consider another way.
